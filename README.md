# myLibrary

## Learning objective
- Prototypes, inheritance, and constructors

## Other things I learned
- JSON stringify and parse.
    - The functions are really simple. One problem I had was with circular reference. I was able to eliminate the circular reference in my code, but if that would not have been possible, I don't know what I'd have done.
    - Passing a strigified object and parsing it will give you your object back, but you lose prototype and all the methods and properties that go with it. That's a bummer.
- Localstorage
